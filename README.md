# Obstacle-avoidance
Obstacle avoidance algorithm with simulation. The red circle's objective is to touch the green one. However, the obstacles on its way aren't making its job easier. Needless to say, its still a walk in the park for our obstacle detection and avoidance algorithm.

# How to run it?
Simply clone the repository or download the obstacly.py file and execute it. The simulation should pop up on your screen as a new window.
